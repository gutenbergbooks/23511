    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      They had lived within a mile of each other for fifty-odd years, old Judge
      Hampden and old Colonel Drayton; that is, all their lives, for they had
      been born on adjoining plantations within a month of each other. But
      though they had thus lived and were accounted generally good men and good
      neighbors, to each other they had never been neighbors any more than the
      LÃ©vite was neighbor to him who went down to Jericho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kindly to everyone else and ready to do their part by all other men, the
      Draytons and the Hampdens, whenever they met each other, always passed by
      on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an old story&mdash;the feud between the families&mdash;and,
      perhaps, no one now knew just how the trouble started. They had certainly
      been on opposite sides ever since they established themselves in early
      Colonial days on opposite hills in the old county from which the two
      mansions looked at each other across the stream like hostile forts. The
      earliest records of the county were those of a dispute between one Colonel
      Drayton and one Captain Hampden, growing out of some claim to land; but in
      which the chief bitterness appeared to have been injected by Captain
      Hampden's having claimed precedence over Colonel Drayton on the ground
      that his title of &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; was superior to Colonel Drayton's title,
      because he had held a real commission and had fought for it, whereas the
      Colonel's title was simply honorary and &ldquo;Ye sayd Collonel had never
      smelled enough powder to kill a tom-cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However this might be and there was nothing in the records to show how
      this contention was adjudicated&mdash;in the time of Major Wil-mer Drayton
      and Judge Oliver Hampden, the breach between the two families had been
      transmitted from father to son for several generations and showed no signs
      of abatement. Other neighborhood families intermarried, but not the
      Drayton-Hall and the Hampden-Hill families, and in time it came to be an
      accepted tradition that a Drayton and a Hampden would not mingle any more
      than would fire and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hampdens were dark and stout, hot-blooded, fierce, and impetuous. They
      were apparently vigorous; but many of them died young. The Draytons, on
      the other hand, were slender and fair, and usually lived to a round old
      age; a fact of which they were wont to boast in contrast with the briefer
      span of the Hampdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their tempers burn them out,&rdquo; the Major used to say of the Hampdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the Draytons were generally cool-headed, deliberate, and
      self-contained. Thus, the Draytons had mainly prospered throughout the
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the winding creek which ran down through the strip of meadow was a
      fruitful cause of dissension and litigation between the families. &ldquo;It is
      as ungovernable as a Hampden's temper, sir,&rdquo; once said Major Drayton, On
      the mere pretext of a thunder-storm, it would burst forth from its banks,
      tear the fences to pieces and even change its course, cutting a new
      channel, now to one side and now to the other through the soft and loamy
      soil. A lawsuit arose over the matter, in which the costs alone amounted
      to far more than the value of the whole land involved; but no one doubted
      that old Major Drayton spoke the truth when he declared that his father
      would rather have lost his entire estate with all its rolling hills and
      extensive forests than the acre or two which was finally awarded to Judge
      Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      As neither owner would join the other even in keeping up a partition
      fence, there were two fences run within three feet of each other along the
      entire boundary line between the two places. With these double fences,
      there could hardly be peace between the two families; for neither owner
      ever saw the two lines running side by side without at once being reminded
      of his neighbor's obstinacy and&mdash;of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in my time the quarrel between the Drayton-Hall people and the
      Hampden-Hill folks was a factor in every neighborhood problem or
      proposition from a &ldquo;church dressing&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sewing society meeting&rdquo; to a
      political campaign. It had to be considered in every invitation and in
      every discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not meant that there was no intercourse between the two families.
      Major Drayton and Judge Hampden regularly paid each other a visit every
      year&mdash;and oftener when there was serious illness in one house or the
      other&mdash;but even on such occasions their differences were liable to
      crop out. One of them held an opinion that when one gentleman was spending
      the night in another gentleman's house, it was the part of the host to
      indicate when bedtime had arrived; whilst the other maintained with equal
      firmness the doctrine that no gentleman could inform his guest that he was
      fatigued: that this duty devolved upon the guest himself. This difference
      of opinion worked comfortably enough on both sides until an occasion when
      Judge Hampden, who held the former view, was spending the night at Colonel
      Drayton's. When bedtime arrived, the rest of the household retired
      quietly, leaving the two gentlemen conversing, and when the servants
      appeared in the morning to open the blinds and light the fires, the two
      gentlemen were still found seated opposite each other conversing together
      quite as if it were the ordinary thing to sit up and talk all night long.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion, it is said that Major Drayton, hearing of his
      neighbor's serious illness, rode over to make inquiry about him, and owing
      to a slip of the tongue, asked in a voice of deepest sympathy, &ldquo;Any hopes
      of the old gentleman dying!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Yet, they had once been friends.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before Wilmer Drayton and Oliver Hampden were old enough to understand
      that by all the laws of heredity and custom they should be enemies, they
      had learned to like each other. When they were only a few years old, the
      little creek winding between the two plantations afforded in its strip of
      meadow a delightful neutral territory where the two boys could enjoy
      themselves together, safe from the interference of their grave seniors;
      wading, sailing mimic fleets upon its uncertain currents, fishing
      together, or bathing in the deepest pools it offered in its winding
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked, indeed, for a time as if in the fellowship of these two lads
      the long-standing feud of the Hampdens and Draytons might be ended, at
      last. They went to school together at the academy, where their only
      contests were a generous rivalry. At college they were known as Damon and
      Pythias, and though a natural rivalry, which might in any event have
      existed between them, developed over the highest prize of the institution&mdash;the
      debater's medal&mdash;the generosity of youth saved them. It was even said
      that young Drayton, who for some time had apparently been certain of
      winning, had generously retired in order to defeat a third candidate and
      throw the prize to Oliver Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came home and both went to the Bar, but with different results. Young
      Drayton was learned and unpractical. Oliver Hampden was clever, able, and
      successful, and soon had a thriving practice; while his neighbor's
      learning was hardly known outside the circle of the Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointed in his ambition, Drayton shortly retired from the Bar and
      lived the life of a country gentleman, while his former friend rapidly
      rose to be the head of the Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old friendship might have disappeared in any event, but a new cause
      arose which was certain to end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Fielding was, perhaps, the prettiest girl in all that region. Oliver
      Hampden had always been in love with her. However, Fortune, ever
      capricious, favored Wilmer Drayton, who entered the lists when it looked
      as if Miss Lucy were almost certain to marry her old lover. It appeared
      that Mr. Drayton's indifference had counted for more than the other's
      devotion. He carried off the prize with a dash.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Oliver Hampden, however, was severely stricken by his disappointment,
      he masked it well; for he married not long afterward, and though some said
      it was from pique, there was no more happily married pair in all the
      county.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year later a new Oliver came to keep up the name and tenets of the
      Hampdens. Oliver Hampden, now the head of the Bar, would not have envied
      any man on earth had not his wife died a few years later and left him
      alone with his boy in his big house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Drayton was born two years after young Oliver Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mammies of the two children, as the mammies of their parents had done
      before them, used to talk them over on the edge of the shaded meadow which
      divided the places, and thus young Oliver Hampden, a lusty boy of five,
      came to know little Lucy Drayton fully three years before his father ever
      laid eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hampden was riding around his fences one summer afternoon, and was
      making his way along the double division line with a cloud on his brow as
      the double rows recalled the wide breach with his neighbor and former
      friend, and many memories came trooping at the recollection. Passing
      through a small grove which had been allowed to grow up to shut off a part
      of his view of the Drayton place, as he came out into the meadow his eye
      fell on a scene which made him forget the present with all its wrongs. On
      the green turf before him where butter-cups speckled the ground with
      golden blossoms, was a little group of four persons busily engaged and
      wholly oblivious of the differences which divided the masters of the two
      estates. The two mammies were seated side by side on a bank, sewing and
      talking busily&mdash;their large aprons and caps making a splotch of white
      against the green willows beyond&mdash;and in front of them at a little
      distance a brown-haired boy of five and a yellow-ringleted girl of three
      were at play on the turf, rolling over and over, shouting and laughing in
      their glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the father rested his eyes on the group, the frown which had for a
      second lowered on his brow passed away and he pulled in his horse so as
      not to disturb them. He was about to turn back and leave them in their
      happiness when his black-eyed boy caught sight of him and ran toward him,
      shouting for a ride and calling over his shoulder for &ldquo;Luthy&rdquo; to &ldquo;come on
      too.&rdquo; As there was no escape, Mr. Hampden went forward and, ignoring the
      confusion of the mammies at being caught together, took the boy up before
      him and gave him a ride up and down the meadow. Then nothing else would do
      for Master Oliver but he &ldquo;must take Luthy up, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps 'Luthy' may be afraid of the horse!&rdquo; suggested Mr. Hampden with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But far from it. Led by the little boy who had run to fetch her, she came
      to Mr. Hampden as readily as his own son had done, and, though she gave
      him one of those quick searching glances with which childhood reads
      character, having made sure that he was friendly, she was no more afraid
      of his horse than the boy was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver tried to lift her, and as he tugged at her, the father sat and
      watched with a smile, then leant down and picked her up while the two
      mammies gasped with mingled astonishment and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, she's pretty heavy,&rdquo; said the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, she is,&rdquo; said the father, gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hampden would have taken his son home with him, but the latter
      declined the invitation. He wished to &ldquo;stay with Luthy.&rdquo; So, Mr. Hampden,
      having first set the nurses' minds at ease by complimenting the little
      girl in warm terms to her mammy, rode home alone with his face set in deep
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breach between the Hampdens and the Draytons was nearer being closed
      that evening than it had been in three generations, for as Oliver Hampden
      rode up the bridle path across his fields, he heard behind him the merry
      laughter of the two children in the quiet meadow below, and old memories
      of his childhood and college life softened his heart. He forgot the
      double-line fences and determined to go on the morrow to Drayton Hall and
      make up the quarrel. He would offer the first overture and a full
      declaration of regret, and this, he was quite sure, would make it up. Once
      he actually turned his horse around to go straight across the fields as he
      used to do in his boyhood, but there below him were the double-line fences
      stretching brown and clear. No horse could get over them, and around the
      road it was a good five miles, so he turned back again and rode home and
      the chance was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival he found a summons in a suit which had been instituted that
      day by Wilmer Drayton for damages to his land by reason of his turning the
      water of the creek upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hampden did not forbid old Lydia to take his boy down there again, but
      he went to the meadow no more himself, and when he and Wilmer Drayton met
      next, which was not for some time, they barely spoke.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Young Oliver Hampden grew up clear eyed, strong, and good to look at, and
      became shy where girls were concerned, and most of all appeared to be shy
      with Lucy Drayton. He went to college and as he got his broad shoulders
      and manly stride he got over his shyness with most girls, but not with
      Lucy Drayton. With her, he appeared to have become yet more reserved. She
      had inherited her mother's eyes and beauty, with the fairness of a lily; a
      slim, willowy figure; a straight back and a small head set on her
      shoulders in a way that showed both blood and pride. Moreover, she had
      character enough, as her friends knew: those gray eyes that smiled could
      grow haughty with disdain or flash with indignation, and she had taught
      many an uppish young man to feel her keen irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gets only her intellect from the Dray-tons; her beauty and her
      sweetness come from her mother,&rdquo; said a lady of the neighborhood to Judge
      Hampden, thinking to please him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gets both her brains and beauty from her mother and only her name
      from her father,&rdquo; snapped the Judge, who had often seen her at church, and
      never without recalling Lucy Fielding as he knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she and young Oliver Hampden fought goes without saying. But no one
      knew why she was cruelly bitter to a young man who once spoke slightingly
      of Oliver, or why Oliver, who rarely saw her except at church, took up a
      quarrel of hers so furiously.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The outbreak of the war, or rather the conditions preceding that outbreak,
      finally fixed forever the gulf between the two families. Judge Hampden was
      an ardent follower of Calhoun and &ldquo;stumped&rdquo; the State in behalf of
      Secession, whereas Major Drayton, as the cloud that had been gathering so
      long rolled nearer, emerged from his seclusion and became one of the
      sternest opponents of a step which he declared was not merely revolution,
      but actual rebellion. So earnest was he, that believing that slavery was
      the ultimate bone of contention, he emancipated his slaves on a system
      which he thought would secure their welfare. Nothing could have more
      deeply stirred Judge Hampden's wrath. He declared that such a measure at
      such a crisis was a blow at every Southern man. He denounced Major Drayton
      as &ldquo;worse than Garrison, Phillips, and Greeley all put together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They at last met in debate at the Court House. Major Drayton exasperated
      the Judge by his coolness, until the latter lost his temper and the crowd
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not get as hot as you do,&rdquo; said the Major, blandly. He looked as
      cool as a cucumber, but his voice betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; snorted the Judge. &ldquo;A mule gets as hot as a horse, but
      he does not sweat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This saved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came near being a duel. Everyone expected it. Only the interposition
      of friends prevented their meeting on the field. Only this and one other
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though no one in the neighborhood knew it until long afterward&mdash;and
      then only in a conjectural way by piecing together fragments of rumors
      that floated about&mdash;young Oliver Hampden really prevented the duel.
      He told his father that he loved Lucy Drayton. There was a fierce outbreak
      on the Judge's part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry that girl!&mdash;the daughter of Wilmer Drayton! I will disinherit
      you if you but so much as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; The younger man faced him and held up his hand with an imperious
      gesture. &ldquo;Stop! Do not say a word against her or I may never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father paused with his sentence unfinished, for his son stood before
      him suddenly revealed in a strength for which the Judge had never given
      him credit, and he recognized in his level eyes, tense features, and the
      sudden set of the square jaw, the Hampden firmness at its best or worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to say against her,&rdquo; said the Judge, with a sudden rush of
      recollection of Lucy Fielding. &ldquo;I have no doubt she is in one way all you
      think her; but she is Wilmer Drayton 's daughter. You will never win her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will win her,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Judge Hampden thought deeply over the matter, and before
      daylight he had despatched a note to Major Drayton making an apology for
      the words he had used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Judge Hampden and his son went into the army immediately on the
      outbreak of hostilities. Major Drayton, who to the last opposed Secession
      bitterly, did not volunteer until after the State had seceded; but then
      he, also, went in, and later was desperately wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few nights before they went off to the war, Judge Hampden and his son
      rode over together to Major Drayton's to offer the olive-branch of peace
      in shape of young Oliver and all that he possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Hampden did not go all the way, for he had sworn never to put foot
      again in Major Drayton's house so long as he lived, and, moreover, he felt
      that his son would be the better ambassador alone. Accordingly, he waited
      in the darkness at the front gate while his son presented himself and laid
      at Lucy Drayton's feet what the Judge truly believed was more than had
      ever been offered to any other woman. He, however, sent the most
      conciliatory messages to Major Drayton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I will take down my fence and he shall run the
      line to suit himself.&rdquo; He could not have gone further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time that passed appeared unending to the Judge waiting in the
      darkness; but in truth it was not long, for the interview was brief. It
      was with Major Drayton and not with his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Drayton declined, both on his daughter's part and on his own, the
      honor which had been proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door opened and Lucy herself appeared. She was a vision
      of loveliness. Her face was white, but her eyes were steady. If she knew
      what had occurred, she gave no sign of it in words. She walked straight to
      her father's side and took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Hampden has done us the honor to ask your hand and I
      have declined it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa.&rdquo; Her eyelids fluttered and her bosom heaved, but she did not
      move, and Lucy was too much a Drayton to unsay what her father had said,
      or to undo what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver Hampden's eyes did not leave her face. For him the Major had
      disappeared, and he saw only the girl who stood before him with a face as
      white as the dress she wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy, I love you. Will you ever care for me? I am going&mdash;going away
      to-morrow, and I shall not see you any more; but I would like to know if
      there is any hope.&rdquo; The young man's voice was strangely calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl held out her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never marry anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait for you all my life,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending low, he kissed her hand in the palm, and with a bow to her father,
      strode from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge, waiting at the gate in the darkness, heard the far-off,
      monotonous galloping of Oliver's horse on the hard plantation road. He
      rode forward to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They declined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father scarcely knew his son's voice, it was so wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Who declined? Did you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out in the darkness Judge Hampden broke forth into such a torrent of rage
      that his son was afraid for his life and had to devote all his attention
      to soothing him. He threatened to ride straight to Drayton's house and
      horsewhip him on the spot. This, however, the young man prevented, and the
      two rode home together in a silence which was unbroken until they had
      dismounted at their own gate and given their horses to the waiting
      servants. As they entered the house, Judge Hampden spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are satisfied,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;I make but one request of
      you&mdash;that from this time forth, you will never mention the name of
      Drayton to me again as long as you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I should hate her,&rdquo; said the son, bitterly, &ldquo;but I do not. I
      love her and I believe she cares for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father turned in the door-way and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cares for you! Not so much as she cares for the smallest negro on that
      place. If you ever marry her, I will disinherit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disinherit me!&rdquo; burst from the young man. &ldquo;Do you think I care for this
      place? What has it ever brought to us but unhappiness? I have seen your
      life embittered by a feud with your nearest neighbor, and now it wrecks my
      happiness and robs me of what I would give all the rest of the world for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Hampden looked at him curiously. He started to say, &ldquo;Before I would
      let her enter this house, I would burn it with my own hands&rdquo;; but as he
      met his son's steadfast gaze there was that in it which made him pause.
      The Hampden look was in his eyes. The father knew that another word might
      sever them forever.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      If ever a man tried to court death, young Oliver Hampden did. But Death,
      that struck many a happier man, passed him by, and he secured instead only
      a reputation for reckless courage and was promoted on the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father rose to the command of a brigade, and Oliver himself became a
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the bullet Oliver had sought found him; but it spared his life and
      only incapacitated him for service.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no trained nurses during the war, and Lucy Drayton, like so
      many girls, when the war grew fiercer, went into the hospitals, and by
      devotion supplied their place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing that life was ended for her, she had devoted herself wholly to
      the cause, and self-repression had given to her face the gentleness and
      consecration of a nun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that once as she bent over a wounded common soldier, he
      returned to consciousness, and after gazing up at her a moment, asked
      vaguely, &ldquo;Who are you, Miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am one of the sisters whom our Father has sent to nurse you and help
      you to get well. But you must not talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wounded man closed his eyes and then opened them with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; just one word. Will you please ask your pa if I may be his
      son-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into the hospital was brought one day a soldier so broken and bandaged
      that no one but Lucy Drayton might have recognized Oliver Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time his life was despaired of; but he survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      When consciousness returned to him, the first sound he heard was a voice
      which had often haunted him in his dreams, but which he had never expected
      to hear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that!&rdquo; he asked, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Oliver&mdash;it is Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wounded man moved slightly and the girl bending over him caught the
      words, whispered brokenly to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was not dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Drayton's devotion probably brought him back from death and saved his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hell of that hospital one man at least found the balm for his
      wounds. When he knew how broken he was he offered Lucy her release. Her
      reply was in the words of the English girl to the wounded Napier, &ldquo;If
      there is enough of you left to hold your soul, I will marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was sufficiently convalescent, they were married.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy insisted that General Hampden should be informed, but the young man
      knew his father's bitterness, and refused. He relied on securing his
      consent later, and Lucy, fearing for her patient's life, and having
      secured her own father's consent, yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver Hampden misjudged the depth of his father's feeling, and General
      Hampden was mortally offended by his having married without informing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver adored his father and he sent him a present in token of his desire
      for forgiveness; but the General had been struck deeply. The present was
      returned. He wrote: &ldquo;I want obedience; not sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confident of his wife's ability to overcome any obstacle, the young man
      bided his time. His wounds, however, and his breach with his father
      affected his health so much that he went with his wife to the far South,
      where Major Drayton, now a colonel, had a remnant of what had once been a
      fine property. Here, for a time, amid the live-oaks and magnolias he
      appeared to improve. But his father's obdurate refusal to forgive his
      disobedience preyed on his health, and just after the war closed, he died
      a few months before his son was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his last days he dwelt much on his father. He made excuses for him,
      over which his wife simply tightened her lips, while her gray eyes burned
      with deep resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was brought up that way. He cannot help it. He never had anyone to
      gainsay him. Do not be hard on him. And if he ever sues for pardon, be
      merciful to him for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His end came too suddenly for his wife to notify his father in advance,
      even if she would have done so; for he had been fading gradually and at
      the last the flame had flared up a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Hampden was too upright a woman not to do what she believed her duty,
      however contrary to her feelings it might be. So, although it was a bitter
      thing to her, she wrote to inform General Hampden of his son's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened by one of the malign chances of fortune that this letter never
      reached its destination, General Hampden did not learn of Oliver's death
      until some weeks later, when he heard of it by accident. It was a terrible
      blow to him, for time was softening the asperity of his temper, and he had
      just made up his mind to make friends with his son. He attributed the
      failure to inform him of Oliver's illness and death to the malignity of
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that when her son was born, Lucy Hampden made no
      announcement of his birth to the General, and he remained in ignorance of
      it.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The war closed, and about the only thing that appeared to remain unchanged
      was the relation between General Hampden and Colonel Drayton. Everything
      else underwent a change, for war eats up a land.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Hampden, soured and embittered by his domestic troubles, but stern
      in his resolve and vigorous in his intellect, was driven by his loneliness
      to adapt himself to the new conditions. He applied his unabated energies
      to building up a new fortune. His decision, his force, and his ability
      soon placed him at the head of one of the earliest new enterprises in the
      State&mdash;a broken-down railway&mdash;which he re-organized and brought
      to a full measure of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Drayton, on the other hand, broken in body and in fortunes, found
      it impossible to adapt himself to the new conditions. He possessed none of
      the practical qualities of General Hampden. With a mind richly stored with
      the wisdom of others, he had the temperament of a dreamer and poet and was
      unable to apply it to any practical end. As shy and reserved as his
      neighbor was bold and aggressive, he lived in his books and had never been
      what is known as a successful man. Even before the war he had not been
      able to hold his own. The exactions of hospitality and of what he deemed
      his obligations to others had consumed a considerable part of the handsome
      estate he had inherited, and his plantation was mortgaged. What had been
      thus begun, the war had completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his plantation was sold, his old neighbor and enemy bought it, and
      the Colonel had the mortification of knowing that Drayton Hall was at last
      in the hands of a Hampden. What he did not know was that General Hampden,
      true to his vow, never put his foot on the plantation except to ride down
      the road and see that all his orders for its proper cultivation were
      carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Drayton tried teaching school, but it appeared that everyone else
      was teaching at that time, and after attempting it for a year or two, he
      gave it up and confined himself to writing philosophical treatises for the
      press, which were as much out of date as the Latin and Greek names which
      he signed to them. As these contributions were usually returned, he
      finally devoted himself to writing agricultural essays for an agricultural
      paper, in which he met with more success than he had done when he was
      applying his principles himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If farms were made of paper he 'd beat Cincinnatus,&rdquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Hampden, thrown on her own resources, in the town in the South in
      which her husband had died, had for some time been supporting herself and
      her child by teaching. She had long urged her father to come to them, but
      he had always declined, maintaining that a man was himself only in the
      country, and in town was merely a unit. When, however, the plantation was
      sold and his daughter wrote for him, he went to her, and the first time
      that the little boy was put in his arms, both he and she knew that he
      would never go away again. That evening as they sat together in the fading
      light on the veranda of the little house which Lucy had taken, amid the
      clambering roses and jasmine, the old fellow said, &ldquo;I used to think that I
      ought to have been killed in battle at the head of my men when I was shot,
      but perhaps, I may have been saved to bring up this young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His daughter's smile, as she leant over and kissed him, showed very
      clearly what she thought of it, and before a week was out, the Colonel
      felt that he was not only still of use, but was, perhaps, the most
      necessary, and, with one exception, the most important member of the
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there were hard times before them. The Colonel was too
      old-fashioned; too slow for the new movement of life, and just enough
      behind the times to be always expecting to succeed and always failing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where the father failed the daughter succeeded. She soon came to be
      known as one of the efficient women of the community, as her father, who
      was now spoken of as &ldquo;the old Colonel,&rdquo; came to be recognized as one of
      the picturesque figures of that period. He was always thought of in
      connection with the boy. The two were hardly ever apart, and they were
      soon known throughout the town&mdash;the tall, thin old gentleman who
      looked out on the world with his mild blue eyes and kindly face, and the
      chubby, red-cheeked, black-eyed boy, whose tongue was always prattling,
      and who looked out with his bright eyes on all the curious things which,
      common-place to the world, are so wonderful to a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendship between an old man and a little child is always touching;
      they grow nearer together day by day, and the old Colonel and little
      Oliver soon appeared to understand each other, and to be as dependent on
      each other as if they had both been of the same age. The child, somewhat
      reserved with others, was bold enough with his grandfather. They held long
      discussions together over things that interested the boy; went
      sight-seeing in company to where the water ran over an old mill-wheel, or
      where a hen and her chickens lived in a neighbor's yard, or a litter of
      puppies gamboled under an outhouse, or a bird had her nest and little ones
      in a jasmine in an old garden, and Colonel Drayton told the boy wonderful
      stories of the world which was as unknown to him as the present world was
      to the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So matters went, until the Christmas when the boy was seven years old.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime, General Hampden was facing a new foe. His health had suddenly
      given way, and he was in danger of becoming blind. His doctor had given
      him his orders&mdash;orders which possibly he might not have taken had not
      the spectre of a lonely old man in total darkness begun to haunt him. He
      had been &ldquo;working too hard,&rdquo; the doctor told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working hard! Of course, I have been working hard!&rdquo; snapped the General,
      fiercely, with his black eyes glowering. &ldquo;What else have I to do but work?
      I shall always work hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor knew something of the General 's trouble. He had been a surgeon
      in the hospital where young Oliver Hampden had been when Lucy Drayton
      found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stop,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;You will not last long unless you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long!&rdquo; demanded the General, quite calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I cannot say that. Perhaps, a year&mdash;perhaps, less. You have
      burned your candle too fast.&rdquo; He glanced at the other's unmoved face. &ldquo;You
      need change. You ought to go South this winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should only change my skies and not my thoughts,&rdquo; said the General, his
      memory swinging back to the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gazed at him curiously. &ldquo;What is the use of putting out your
      eyes and working yourself to death when you have everything that money can
      give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing! I work to forget that,&rdquo; snarled the General, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General thought over the doctor's advice and finally followed it,
      though not for the reason the physician supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something led him to select the place where his son had gone and where his
      body lay amid the magnolias. If he was going to die, he would carry out a
      plan which he had formed in the lonely hours when he lay awake between the
      strokes of the clock. He would go and see that his son's grave was cared
      for, and if he could, would bring him back home at last. Doubtless, &ldquo;that
      woman's&rdquo; consent could be bought. She had possibly married again. He hoped
      she had.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christmas is always the saddest of seasons to a lonely man, and General
      Hampden, when he landed in that old Southern town on the afternoon of
      Christmas Eve, would not have been lonelier in a desert. The signs of
      Christmas preparation and the sounds of Christmas cheer but made him
      lonelier. For years, flying from the Furies, he had immersed himself in
      work and so, in part, had forgotten his troubles; but the removal of this
      prop let him fall flat to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the old fellow had gotten settled in his room at the hotel he
      paid a visit to his son's grave, piloted to the cemetery by a friendly and
      garrulous old negro hackman, who talked much about Christmas and &ldquo;the
      holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh, dat he had known Cap'n Ham'n. He used to drive him out long as
      he could drive out. He had been at his funeral. He knew Mrs. Ham'n, too.
      She sutney is a fine lady,&rdquo; he wound up in sincere eulogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General gave a grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was nearer to his son than he had ever been since the day he last saw
      him in all the pride and beauty of a gallant young soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave, at least, was not neglected. It was marked by a modest cross,
      on which was the Hampden coat-of-arms and the motto, &ldquo;<i>Loyal</i>,&rdquo; and
      it was banked in fresh evergreens, and some flowers had been placed on it
      only that afternoon. It set the General to thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to his hotel, he found the loneliness unbearable. His
      visit to his son's grave had opened the old wound and awakened all his
      memories. He knew now that he had ruined his life. The sooner the doctor's
      forecast came true, the better. He had no care to live longer. He would
      return to work and die in harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent his servant to the office and arranged for his car to be put on
      the first train next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to escape from his thoughts, he strolled out in the street where the
      shopping crowds streamed along, old and young, poor and well-to-do, their
      arms full of bundles, their faces eager, and their eyes alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Hampden seemed to himself to be walking among ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stalked on, bitter and lonely, he was suddenly run into by a very
      little boy, in whose small arms was so big a bundle that he could scarcely
      see over it. The shock of the collision knocked the little fellow down,
      sitting flat on the pavement, still clutching his bundle. But his face
      after the first shadow of surprise lit up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir&mdash;that was my fault,&rdquo; he said, with so quaint
      an imitation of an old person that the General could not help smiling.
      With a cheery laugh, he tried to rise to his feet, but the bundle was too
      heavy, and he would not let it go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General bent over him and, with an apology, set him on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg <i>your</i> pardon, sir. That was <i>my</i> fault. That is a pretty
      big bundle you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and I tell you, it is pretty heavy, too,&rdquo; the manikin said,
      proudly. &ldquo;It 's a Christmas gift.&rdquo; He started on, and the General turned
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Christmas gift! It must be a fine one. Who gave it to you?&rdquo; demanded
      the General, with a smile at the little fellow's confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fine one! Did n't anybody give it to me. We 're giving it to
      somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You are? To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll tell you; but you must promise not to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise I will not tell a soul. I cross my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a sign as he remembered he used to do in his boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up at him doubtfully with a shade of disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather says that you must not cross your heart&mdash;'t a
      gentleman's word is enough,&rdquo; he said, quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he does? Well, I give my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; He glanced around to see that no one was listening, and
      sidling a little nearer, lowered his voice: &ldquo;It 's a great-coat for
      grandfather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great-coat! That's famous!&rdquo; exclaimed the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, is n't it? You see&mdash;he 's mighty old and he 's got a bad cough&mdash;he
      caught it in the army, and I have to take care of him. Don't you think
      that's right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I do,&rdquo; said the General, envying one grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I tell him. So mamma and I have bought this for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be a proud grandfather,&rdquo; said the General, with envy biting
      deeper at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have another grandfather; but I don't like <i>him</i>,&rdquo; continued the
      little fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; said the General, sincerely. &ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was mean to my father, and he is mean to my mother.&rdquo; His voice
      conveyed a sudden bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma says I must like him; but I do not. I just can't. You would not
      like a man who was mean to your mother, would you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; declared the General, truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am not going to like him,&rdquo; asserted the boy, with firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General suddenly pitied one grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to a well-lighted corner, and as the boy lifted his face,
      the light fell on it. Something about the bright, sturdy countenance with
      its frank, dark eyes and brown hair suddenly sent the General back thirty
      years to a strip of meadow on which two children were playing: one a
      dark-eyed boy as sturdy as this one. It was like an arrow in his heart.
      &ldquo;With a gasp he came back to the present. His thoughts pursued him even
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he asked as he was feeling in his pocket for a coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Drayton Hampden, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were perfectly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's heart stopped beating and then gave a bound. The skies
      suddenly opened for him and then shut up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His exclamation brought the child to a stop and he glanced up at him in
      vague wonder. The General stooped and gazed at him searchingly, almost
      fiercely. The next second he had pounced upon him and lifted him in his
      arms while the bundle fell to the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy! I am your grandfather,&rdquo; he cried, kissing him violently. &ldquo;I am
      your grandfather Hampden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child was lost in amazement for a moment, and then, putting his hands
      against the General's face, he pushed him slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put me down, please,&rdquo; he said, with that gravity which in a child means
      so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Hampden set him down on the pavement. The boy looked at him
      searchingly for a second, and then turned in silence and lifted his
      bundle. The General's face wore a puzzled look&mdash;he had solved many
      problems, but he had never had one more difficult than this. His heart
      yearned toward the child, and he knew that on his own wisdom at that
      moment might depend his future happiness. On his next words might hang for
      him life or death. The expression on the boy's face, and the very set of
      his little back as he sturdily tugged at his burden, recalled his father,
      and with it the General recognized the obstinacy which he knew lurked in
      the Hampden blood, which had once been his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; he said, gravely, leaning down over the boy and putting his hand
      on him gently, &ldquo;there has been a great mistake. I am going home with you
      to your mother and tell her so. I want to see her and your grandfather,
      and I think I can explain everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child turned and gazed at him seriously, and then his face relaxed. He
      recognized his deep sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; He turned and walked down the street, bending under his
      burden. The General offered to carry it for him, but he declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can carry it,&rdquo; was the only answer he made except once when, as the
      General rather insisted, he said firmly, &ldquo;I want to carry it myself,&rdquo; and
      tottered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell on them for a moment. A young man passing them spoke to the
      child cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Oliver! A Christmas present?&mdash;That 's a great boy,&rdquo; he said,
      in sheer friendliness to the General, and passed on. The boy was evidently
      well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver nodded; then feeling that some civility was due on his part to his
      companion, he said briefly, &ldquo;That 's a friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General, even in his perplexity, smiled at the quaint way the child
      imitated the manners of older men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then they came to a little gate and the boy's manner changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will wait, I will run around and put my bundle down. I am afraid
      my grandfather might see it.&rdquo; He lowered his voice for the first time
      since the General had introduced himself. Then he disappeared around the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, having slipped in at the back door and carefully reconnoitred the
      premises, tripped up stairs with his bundle to his mother's room. He was
      so excited over his present that he failed to observe her confusion at his
      sudden entrance, or her hasty hiding away of something on which she was
      working. Colonel Drayton was not the only member of that household that
      Christmas who was to receive a great-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Oliver had untied his bundle, nothing would serve but he must put on
      the coat to show his mother how his grandfather would look in it. As even
      with the sleeves rolled up and with his arms held out to keep it from
      falling off him, the tails dragged for some distance on the floor and only
      the top of his head was visible above the collar, the resemblance was
      possibly not wholly exact. But it appeared to satisfy the boy. He was
      showing how his grandfather walked, when he suddenly recalled his new
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met my other grandfather, on the street, mamma, and he came home with
      me.&rdquo; He spoke quite naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Met your other grandfather!&rdquo; Mrs. Hampden looked mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is my grandfather, and he looks like papa. I reckon he 's my
      other grandfather. He ran against me in the street and knocked me down,
      and then came home with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came home with you!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Hampden, still in a maze, and with a
      vague trouble dawning in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes 'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver went over the meeting again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's face meantime showed the tumult of emotion that was sweeping
      over her. Why had General Hampden come? What had he come for? To try and
      take her boy from her?
    </p>
    <p>
      At the thought her face and form took on something of the lioness that
      guards her whelp. Then as the little boy repeated what his grandfather had
      said of his reason for coming home with him, her face softened again. She
      heard a voice saying, &ldquo;If he ever sues for pardon, be merciful to him for
      my sake.&rdquo; She remembered what day it was: the Eve of the day of Peace and
      Good-will toward all men. He must have come for Peace, and Peace it should
      be. She would not bring up her boy under the shadow of that feud which had
      blighted both sides of his race so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must go down and let him in. Say I will come
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not like him,&rdquo; said the child, his eyes on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you must; he is your grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not love him, and I will not.&rdquo; The sturdy little figure and the
      serious face with the chin already firm for such a child, the dark, grave
      eyes and the determined speech, were so like his father that the widow
      gave half a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, my son, and I will try. Your father would wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little boy pondered for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, mamma; but he must be good to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the little fellow left the room, the widow threw herself on her knees.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      As General Hampden stood and waited in the dusk, he felt that his whole
      life and future depended on the issue of the next few moments. He
      determined to take matters in his own hand. Every moment might tell
      against him and might decide his fate. So, without waiting longer, he rang
      the bell. A minute later he heard steps within, and the door was opened by
      one who he knew must be Colonel Drayton, though had he met him elsewhere
      he should not have recognized the white hair and the thin, bent form as
      that of his old friend and enemy. Colonel Drayton had evidently not seen
      his grandson yet, for he spoke as to a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not walk in, sir!&rdquo; he said cordially. &ldquo;I was expecting my little
      grandson who went out a short while ago.&rdquo; He peered up the street. &ldquo;Did
      you wish to see my daughter? You will find us in a little confusion&mdash;Christinas
      time is always a busy season with us on account of our young man: my
      grandson.&rdquo; He lingered with pride over the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General stepped into the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilmer Drayton! Don't you know me? I am Oliver Hampden, and I have come
      to apologize to you for all I have done which has offended you, and to ask
      you to be friends with me.&rdquo; He held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Colonel stepped back, and under the shock of surprise paused for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Hampden!&rdquo; The next moment he stepped forward and took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Oliver,&rdquo; he said, gently, and putting his other arm around the
      General's shoulder, he handed him into the little cosey, fire-lighted room
      as though nothing had happened since he had done the same the last time
      fifty years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door opened and the little boy entered with mingled
      mysteriousness and importance. Seeing the two gentlemen standing together,
      he paused with a mystified look in his wide-open eyes, trying to
      comprehend the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver, come here,&rdquo; said the Colonel, quietly. &ldquo;This is your other
      grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy came forward, and, wheeling, stood close beside the Colonel,
      facing General Hampden, like a soldier dressing by his file-closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are my grandfather,&rdquo; he said, glancing up at the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel's eyes glowed with a soft light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy; and so is he. We are friends again, and you must love him&mdash;just
      as you do me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not love him as much,&rdquo; was the sturdy answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the General who spoke next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right, my boy. All I ask is that you will love me some.&rdquo; He was
      pleading with this young commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, if you are good to my mother.&rdquo; His eyes were fastened on him
      without a tremor, and the General's deep-set eyes began to glow with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 's a bargain,&rdquo; he said holding out his hand. The boy took it
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door opened and Lucy Hampden entered. Her face was calm and
      her form was straight. Her eyes, deep and burning, showed that she was
      prepared either for peace or war. It was well for the General that he had
      chosen peace. Better otherwise had he charged once more the deadliest
      battle line he had ever faced. For a moment the General saw only Lucy
      Fielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a woman's instinct the young widow comprehended at the first glance
      what had taken place, and although her face was white, her eyes softened
      as she advanced. The General had turned and faced her. He could not utter
      a word, but the boy sprang towards her and, wheeling, stood by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his hand, she led him forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;this is your father's father.&rdquo; Then to the
      General, in a dead silence&mdash;&ldquo;Father, this is your son's son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General clasped them both in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me. Forgive me. I have prayed for <i>his</i> forgiveness, for I
      can never forgive myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He forgave you,&rdquo; said the widow, simply.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      No young king was ever put to bed with more ceremony or more devotion than
      was that little boy that night. Two old gentlemen were his grooms of the
      bedchamber and saw him to bed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk was all of Christmas, and the General envied the ease with which
      the other grandfather carried on the conversation. But when the boy,
      having kissed his grandfather, said of his own accord, &ldquo;Now, I must kiss
      my <i>other</i> grandfather,&rdquo; he envied no man on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning when Oliver Hampden, before the first peep of light,
      waked in his little bed, which stood at the foot of his grandfather's bed
      in the tiny room which they occupied together, and standing up, peeped
      over the footboard to catch his grandfather's &ldquo;Christmas gift,&rdquo; he was
      surprised to find that the bed was empty and undisturbed. Then having
      tiptoed in and caught his mother, he stole down the stairs and softly
      opened the sitting-room door where he heard the murmur of voices. The fire
      was burning dim, and on either side sat the two old gentlemen in their
      easy chairs, talking amicably and earnestly as they had been talking when
      he kissed them &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo; Neither one had made the suggestion that it
      was bedtime; but when at the first break of day the rosy boy in his
      night-clothes burst in upon them with his shout of &ldquo;Christmas gift,&rdquo; and
      his ringing laughter, they both knew that the long feud was at last ended,
      and peace was established forever.
